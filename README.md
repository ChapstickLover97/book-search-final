  ## Description 

  A MERN full-stack web app built GraphQL, Apollo Server, React, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js.  The user is able to either log-in or create an account, and search for books using Google's Book Search API.  If they find a title they enjoy, they are able to save it and have it linked directly to their account so, when they select, "view my books", they can see a list of all the books they've saved over their time while using the app.

  ## Dependencies  

  Apollo, Jest, React, Axios, Bootstrap, jwt-decode, GraphQL, MongoDB, Node, Express

  ## Usage 

  Either click the deployed link, at which point it's 100% ready-to-go, or download the entire repo and run "npm run start" on both the front-end and the back-end (client and server), and you'll be good to go!
